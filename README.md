## This project was an exploration of what can be achieved with text and APIs using large language models.

        For my project I built a Fashion Stylist AI. I was inspired by the film Clueless, where the girl had a digital
        wardrobe assistant that could generate the best combination of her clothes to save time.

        Users can upload clothing images, which are classified into one of three categories: t-shirt, jeans, or shoes.
        The results are stored in a wardrobe database through the FashionWardrobe API, where items can be viewed, saved,
        or deleted.

        The system also includes a second API, FashionOutfitSuggester, which randomly selects items from the wardrobe
        (one t-shirt, one pair of jeans, and one pair of shoes) to generate a complete outfit suggestion.

        The challenges were integrating the API properly and ensuring different outfits were selected.

        My project shows how AI classification, API integration, and frontend interaction can be combined to create a
        simple but functional personal styling assistant.
